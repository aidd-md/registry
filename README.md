# aidd.md Registry

> Community-driven registry for MCP servers and AIDD content

This repository is the data source for the [AIDD Hub](https://github.com/DerianAndre/aidd.md) Marketplace. It contains curated entries for:

- **MCP Servers** — Model Context Protocol servers for AI coding agents
- **AIDD Content** — Skills, rules, workflows, templates, knowledge, agents, and specs

## How It Works

1. Contributors add entries as individual files (YAML for MCP servers, Markdown for content)
2. GitHub Actions validates and builds the registry on every PR
3. Built JSON files are committed to `dist/` and served via GitHub raw URLs
4. The AIDD Hub fetches these files to populate the Marketplace

## Browse

| Directory | Content |
|-----------|---------|
| [`mcp-servers/`](mcp-servers/) | MCP server entries (`.yaml`) |
| [`content/agents/`](content/agents/) | Agent definitions |
| [`content/skills/`](content/skills/) | Reusable skills |
| [`content/rules/`](content/rules/) | Domain rules |
| [`content/workflows/`](content/workflows/) | Multi-step workflows |
| [`content/templates/`](content/templates/) | Task templates |
| [`content/knowledge/`](content/knowledge/) | Technology knowledge base |
| [`content/spec/`](content/spec/) | AIDD specifications |

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to add or update entries.

## Built Files

The `dist/` directory contains the compiled registry files:

- `dist/mcp-servers.json` — All MCP server entries
- `dist/content.json` — All content entries

These are auto-generated by CI. Do not edit them directly.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm validate    # Validate all entries
pnpm build       # Build dist/*.json
```
